// A task becomes eligible for execution when:
// It is open
// It has OKs from all departments
// All its sub-tasks are done
// Itâ€™s scoped small enough to execute in one iteration

// Stage    Trigger Agent	Action
// task:eligible	All departments OK	Ready for execution
// task:done	After execution	Archived, DAG updated

// Short, implementable in a single turn, well documented changes, comprehensive context.
