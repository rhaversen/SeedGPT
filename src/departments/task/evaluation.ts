// Judges task clarity, scope, dependencies, and execution feasibility
// Judges task feasibility, cost/benefit, dependencies, clarity
// Is this task clear and scoped?

// Assesses complexity, feasibility, scope, and readiness
// Can split ambiguous tasks or add blockers/dependencies

// Clarity & Completeness
// Does the task have a well-defined goal and acceptance criteria?
// If blurry, it will propose updates to tighten the description or split off unclear pieces.

// Feasibility & Scope
// Is this doable in one iteration?
// If too large or vague, split it into smaller subtasks (e.g. “design API” + “implement API” + “write tests”).

// Effort vs. Impact
// Assign a rough score (e.g. 1–10) for effort and for impact.
// If impact is low relative to effort, it can set priority to low or even reject (“not worth it”).

// Dependency Sanity
// Are all upstream dependencies listed and in a done state?
// If not, it can add missing dependencies or request changes.

// Difficulty Rating
// Labels tasks as easy / medium / hard based on technical complexity.
// Helps Main Agent order the backlog appropriately.
